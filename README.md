Data visualisation using Kaggle dataset

Codecademy meet-up description: 



About this event
In this meet-up, we will work together as a group on a publicly available Kaggle dataset (Adult Depression - Let's Get Healthy California), preview here.  
In keeping with Codecademy's suggested workflow over here and Carnegie Mellon University's Data Science Project Scoping Guide - reference here -, we will proceed as per the following:
1. import dataset

2. look over dataset

3. scope out dataset

4. store dataset via Python variables

5. build out functions that perform the desired analysis, build classes containing methods for analysis



During this meet-up, we will set the groundwork and discuss how to proceed. There will be a follow-up meeting (TBA during meet-up - I am thinking 2-4 weeks post-meetup?) to discuss progress. 
I will share a preview of the data and some of my thoughts and preliminary findings during the meet-up but look forward to making this a collaborative effort. I will share the dataset as a Jupyter notebook in VS Code - if you would like to do the same, do check out the tutorial on how to use Jupyter notebooks in VS Code right here - super helpful!

Here's the scoping framework: 

Step 0: Problem Understanding 
- What is the problem? Who does it impact and how much? How is it being solved today and what are some of the gaps?

Step 1: Goals 
- What are the goals of the project? How will we know if our project is successful?

Step 2: Actions 
- What actions or interventions will this work inform?

Step 3: Data 
- What data do you have access to internally? What data do you need?

>> We will use the Adult Depression dataset linked above as a starting point but remain open to incorporating additional sources

- What can you augment from external and/or public sources?

Step 4: Analysis 
- What analysis needs to be done? Does it involve description, detection, prediction, or behavior change? How will the analysis be validated?

Ethical Considerations: What are the privacy, transparency, discrimination/equity, and accountability issues around this project and how will you tackle them?

Additional Considerations: How will you deploy your analysis as a new system so that it can be updated and integrated into the organizationâ€™s operations? How will you evaluate the new system in the field to make sure it accomplishes your goals? How will you monitor your system to make sure it continues to perform well over time?



See you there!
